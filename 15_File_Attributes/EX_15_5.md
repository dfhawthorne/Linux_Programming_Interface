Exercise 15-5
=============

The man page for [umask(2)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/umask.2.html)
says:

> It is impossible to use umask() to fetch a process's umask without at the same
> time changing it. A second call to umask() would then be needed to restore the
> umask. **The nonatomicity of these two steps provides the potential for races
> in multi-threaded programs.**
>
> Since Linux 4.7, the umask of any process can be viewed via the Umask field of
> `/proc/[pid]/status`. Inspecting this field in `/proc/self/status` allows a
> process to retrieve its umask without at the same time changing it.

Example
-------

```
douglas@coogee:~$ umask
0002
douglas@coogee:~$ grep -i umask: /proc/self/status
Umask:  0002
```
