# Exercise 13-3

What is the effect of the following statements?
```C
fflush(fp);
fsync(fileno(fp));
```

## fflush

The man page for fflush(2) says:
> For  output  streams,  fflush()  forces  a write of all user-space buffered data for the given output or update stream via the stream's underlying write function.

## fsync

The man page for fsync(2) says:

> fsync() transfers ("flushes") all modified in-core data of (i.e., modified buffer cache pages for) the file referred to by the file descriptor fd to the disk device (or other permanent storage device) so that all changed  information  can  be  retrieved even  if  the  system  crashes  or  is rebooted.  This includes writing through or flushing a disk cache if present.  The call blocks until the device reports that the transfer has completed.
> 
> As well as flushing the file data, fsync() also flushes the metadata information associated with the file (see inode(7)).
> 
> Calling fsync() does not necessarily ensure that the entry in the directory containing the file has also  reached  disk.   For that an explicit fsync() on a file descriptor for the directory is also needed.

## Analysis

The `fflush()` call does not necessarily write to disk, but sends all available to the buffer cache pages. These pages are then written to disk through the `fsync()` call.
